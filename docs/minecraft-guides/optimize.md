# How to Optimize Performance

To ensure you have the best experience possible while playing CiviCraft, here are some tips and tricks to optimize your game performance:

## Optimize Video Settings

1. **Adjust Render Distance**: Lower the render distance in video settings to reduce the amount of terrain loaded and improve FPS (Frames Per Second), especially in busy areas.

2. **Graphics Settings**: Opt for lower graphics settings like Fast or Fastest to prioritize performance over visual quality. Disable fancy graphics, reduce particles, and turn off smooth lighting to boost FPS.

3. **Disable V-Sync**: Turning off Vertical Sync (V-Sync) can sometimes improve FPS, but be aware it may cause screen tearing on some setups.

4. **Allocate More RAM**: If your system has extra RAM to spare, allocate more to Minecraft in the launcher settings to help handle server-side tasks and reduce lag spikes.

## Performance Mods

1. **Optifine**: Install Optifine, a mod that enhances graphics and FPS performance through optimizations like better chunk loading and advanced video settings adjustments.

2. **Sodium**: Sodium

3. **FPS Boosting Mod Packs**: Use FPS boost packs or performance-enhancing mods tailored for multiplayer servers to optimize Minecraft's performance on various hardware setups.

## In-Game Settings Tweaks

1. **Entity Distance**: Reduce the maximum distance for entities (mobs, items) in settings to ease strain on the server's CPU and improve overall performance.

2. **Turn Off Fancy Graphics**: Disable fancy options such as clouds, animated textures, and dynamic lights to reduce CPU load and improve responsiveness.

3. **Smooth Lighting**: Adjust smooth lighting to a lower level or turn it off entirely to reduce GPU load and enhance FPS during intensive gameplay.

## System Optimization

1. **Close Background Apps**: Close unnecessary applications running in the background to free up system resources for Minecraft and maintain a stable connection to our server.

2. **Update Java**: Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed as it significantly impacts Minecraft's performance, stability, and compatibility with server plugins.

3. **Update Graphics Drivers**: Keep your graphics card drivers up to date to maximize compatibility and performance improvements, especially in multiplayer environments.

## Server-Specific Tips

1. **Limit Mob Farms**: Excessive mob farms and redstone contraptions can strain the server. Please consult with server rules or admins about limits or recommended practices for building them.

2. **Follow Server Guidelines**: Adhere to any specific rules or guidelines regarding resource packs, mods, or behavior that may affect server performance or fairness to other players.

## Additional Tips

1. **Optimal Resource Packs**: Choose resource packs optimized for multiplayer gameplay to minimize strain on both your client and the server. Higher resolution packs may impact performance.

2. **Monitor Performance**: Use Minecraft's debug screen (F3) to monitor FPS, server tick rate, and memory usage. This information helps you adjust settings and understand how your actions affect server performance.

3. **Regular Maintenance**: Help keep the server running smoothly by reporting any issues promptly and following guidelines for world cleanup and optimization suggested by server staff.

By following these optimization tips and working together with our community, you'll enjoy a smoother and more immersive multiplayer experience on our server. Have fun exploring and building with your fellow players!
