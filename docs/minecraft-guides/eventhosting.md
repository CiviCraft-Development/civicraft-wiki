## Types of Events

### Official Events
Official events are planned and hosted entirely by the Department of Public Affairs. These events are typically large-scale and well-publicized, ensuring high participation and quality execution. Regular players will typically not be involved with these events unless they are employed by the DPA.

**Perks of Official Events:**
- **High Participation**: Official events usually attract a large number of players due to the DPA's promotional efforts.
- **Professional Organization**: With the DPA handling all aspects, these events are often well-organized and run smoothly.
- **Exclusive Rewards**: Participants can expect unique and valuable in-game rewards.

### Partnered Events
Partnered events are collaborative efforts between the DPA and players not employed by the DPA. Both parties work together to plan and host the event, combining resources and ideas for a successful outcome.

**Perks of Partnered Events:**
- **Shared Resources**: Players can leverage the DPA's resources and expertise, while the DPA benefits from fresh ideas and community insights.
- **Balanced Workload**: Responsibilities are shared, making it easier to manage larger or more complex events.
- **Broader Appeal**: These events often blend the professionalism of official events with the personal touch of player-run events.

### Player-Run Events
Player-run events are independently managed by players, with some assistance from the DPA. The DPA may help with promotion, provide resources, or offer advice, but the player takes the lead in planning and execution.

**Perks of Player-Run Events:**
- **Creative Freedom**: Players have full control over the event, allowing for more creativity and personalization.
- **Skill Development**: Players gain hands-on experience in event planning and management.
- **Community Recognition**: Successfully hosting an event can boost a player's reputation and influence within the community.

## Planning Your Event

### Step 1: Come Up with an Idea
Think about what type of event you want to host. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- **Sport Tournaments**: Organize competitions for sports like Soccer, Tennis, and Horse Racing.
- **Building Competitions**: Set a theme and challenge players to create the best build within a time limit.
- **Themed Parties**: Host a costume party or a holiday-themed event with special activities and decorations.

### Step 4: Host the Event
On the day of the event, make sure everything is ready:

- **Prepare the Area**: Set up any necessary structures, signs, or decorations.
- **Explain the Rules**: Make sure all participants understand the rules before starting.
- **Facilitate the Event**: Guide players through the event, resolve any issues, and keep things running smoothly.

## Getting Help from the Department of Public Affairs
If you need assistance with planning or promoting your event, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Department of Public Affairs. They can help you with:

- **Event Planning**: Offering advice and resources for your event.
- **Promotion**: Adding your event to the Events tab on Discord and the promotional channel for events.
- **Support**: Providing staff to help manage the event. This may not be always available.

## Suggesting Event Ideas
If you have a great event idea but don’t want to host it yourself, you can still contribute! Suggest your ideas to the DPA, and they might be able to organize it for you. This way, you can still enjoy the event and see your ideas come to life.

## Conclusion
