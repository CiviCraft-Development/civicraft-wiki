# Rules

## Server Rules
Understanding and knowing the rules and purposes of the various channels is your responsibility, and ignorance of the rules is no excuse for breaking them or avoiding the resulting punishments.

We prioritize community well-being and safety over engaging with toxic individuals. Contribution or position within the server will not be considered when invoking punishment for offenses.

## General
### 1. Be kind and be respectful

1.1 Keep conversations in English. This is for the sake of conversation flow and so that staff do not have to use a translator to check whether you're breaking the rules in another language. Conversations in different languages should be had within DMs.

1.2 Remember the human. Toxic behaviour will not be tolerated. There is a solid separation between what is acceptable within roleplay and what is considered harassment.

1.3 Do not use derogatory terms. This includes racial slurs, disability slurs, homophobic slurs, etc.

1.4 Do not provoke, bait or incite others into breaking rules, or encourage conflict between members. The rulebreakers and those encouraging rule breaking will be punished.

1.5 Do not post or share personal information of others without express permission.

### 2. No spamming

2.1 Spamming is prohibited on this server. This includes but is not limited to image spam, text/link/emoji spam, spam tagging a user or a specific role.

### 3. No drama or personal attacks

3.1 Do not provoke others with emotional/personal attacks. If another user is causing problems, do NOT make it worse - alert staff.

3.2 Refrain from prolonged inappropriate or heated discussions. If a discussion becomes intense or contentious, try to steer it back towards a more respectful and constructive tone. If it's impossible to maintain a civil discussion, it's best to agree to disagree and move on.

3.3 RP-related discussions should never cross personal boundaries. Criticizing someone's character or actions within the game is acceptable within the context of the roleplay, but do not use it as an excuse to attack the player behind the character.

:memo: Staff are available to provide mediation between parties. Open a server support ticket on the Discord and we'll be happy to assist.

### 4. No inappropriate usernames, profile pictures, or nicknames

4.1 Do not imitate or impersonate other players or staff.

4.2 Do not have an inappropriate username, profile picture, or nickname.

:memo: If you have alphabets/scripts which makes it hard to tag you, your nickname will have 'taggable' added as prefix making it 'taggable | <nickname>' to make it easier for staff to tag you.

### 5. Refrain from discussion of IRL sensitive and offensive topics.

5.1 This includes topics such as politics, religion, acts of violence, gore, suicide, school shootings, and other disturbing or offensive material.

:memo: This does not include in-game politics, religion, acts of violence, and so on.
