# Server Advisory Committee

A Server Advisory Committee is a temporary group made for a specific purpose that impacts a server-side operation.
## How Committees are Formed
Server Advisory Committees are formed when a specific and unique need arises that requires the gathering of players to discuss how this need effects the server. Given that CiviCraft values player feedback, we want players to be at the center of every major action, too. 

## Possible Committees
The following is a list of the topics that a committee is most likely to form around.
1. **Performance-Based**
