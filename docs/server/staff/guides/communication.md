# Player Communication Guide

When talking to other players, regardless of the purpose of the interaction, it is important to remember that you are serving as the face of the server. When players watch your interactions, they develop assumptions about the server that impact a number of things. Effective and appropriate communication is the number one driver for creating a positive, engaging environment where players want to continue participating in.

The following guide reviews various directions on how to communicate with players as well as other staff.

## Introduction
As a reminder, this is not meant to forcibly dictate how you communicate on the server, but instead, it's meant to guide your interactions with players.

## General Communication Guidelines

### Respect and Professionalism
Regardless of any situation you may find yourself in, it is important to communicate respectfully and professionally with 

### Clarity and Conciseness
Getting an idea across may be challenging at times due to all the 

### Tone and Language

## Player Interaction

### Welcoming New Players
#### In-Game
#### Discord
There are a two different ways to welcome a new member to the Discord.
1. Built-In Discord Welcoming
Discord offers a built-in feature that allows you to welcome new players with the click of a button. By clicking it, it automatically mentions the new user and sends a gif alongside it. 

While we would like to avoid this given how impersonal it may be, 
2. Personalized Welcoming (Recommended)

    - Welcome to the server @Player! So happy to have you!
    - Hello & welcome @Player! Let me know if you need any help (:

Tip: Try inviting a player to play with you.

Within the first 24 hours of a player being on the Discord, try prioritizing engaging with them. 
### Helping Players & Answering Questions
CiviCraft boasts a number of resources available to players to assist them in learning the server and easily getting an answer to 99% of their questions. In-Game tutorials of various lengths, video guides, a wiki, an in-game book, and more are provided to players. However, we can never assume players will completely engage with these resources if they engage with them at all. While this can create difficulties for them, 

#### Answer the Question Directly

### Handling Player Complaints

#### Ask for Clarification as Needed
When a player makes a complaint, they may include too little detail, too much detail, or present information in a way that is unorganized and otherwise difficult to understand. It's vital to ask for clarification instead of proceeding with what you have been initially given in order to both shorten the process and ensure both you and the player are on the same page. 
#### Repeat the Player's Complaint Back to Them
Being on the same page from the get-go is crucial. When a player makes a complaint, it's important to repeat it to them, but in the way you understand it. This will help to bridge any gaps that may be created from the way the complaint is presented to the way that it is received and interpreted.

When doing this, be mindful of your tone. Check that you don't come off as if you are downplaying the issue or being condescending with your recap.

#### Provide a Detailed Plan
Players love certainty.

Another good component to include is external resources. This provides credibility to your response and gives players something to reference. Be mindful to not leave it at "you can find this here." Instead of doing this, explain what the resource is and give a good summary, but then attach the link to the resource and advise them that they can get this information in more detail there.

### Conflict Resolution
Techniques and approaches for resolving conflicts.

#### Causes of Conflict


Effective project management requires excellent conflict management skills. You will find innumerable causes of conflict throughout your career. People are distracted, worried, and complex. They are also talented, passionate, and knowledgeable. Conflict is inevitable when you bring a diverse group of people onto a team and each is an expert in their field. They will disagree on which software is best, which programming language to use, and where to go for lunch. To add to the complexity, people may conflict about a seemingly surface issue; meanwhile, the actual conflict is unseen and unspoken. For example, perhaps teammates arguing over a color scheme weren’t worried about that at all; instead, they were truly anxious about recent downsizing.

We’ll review a few causes of conflict in project teams in this course. Treat this list as a starting point, and add your own experience to it.

    Personality differences: people have different personalities and working styles, which can create conflict. Teammates need to learn to work together, but expect some friction while they learn how to collaborate.
    Personal issues: people have lives outside their team. Sometimes, their personal life affects how they approach the work, which can affect performance.
    External factors: events outside the group and unrelated to the project can affect the team. For example, conflict increases during reorganizations and severe world events.
    Competition over resources: when teams have inadequate time, supplies, access, or information, it can create a sense of scarcity among team members.
    Conflicting priorities: when team members don’t know where to focus or how to spend their time, it creates prioritization conflicts. For instance, team members could interpret project goals differently or be stretched too thin across many projects.
    Conflicting proposals: sometimes, two team members will create different ideas to solve a problem or approach a deliverable. Usually, this is healthy conflict that helps your team create the best result possible. For example, team members might brainstorm ideas and debate the merits of each to arrive at a solution.
    Communication issues: communication occurs in nearly every project activity. As a result, most conflict stems from communication issues. For example, team members who are active listeners can prevent and resolve conflict faster than those who need to develop their listening skills. Differences in writing styles, including formality, tone, and presentation, can lead to miscommunication and conflict. Cultural differences can include differences in communication, including tone, subtlety, and word choice. It can also include differences in typical expressiveness, body language, and personal space. Conflicting cultural norms can lead to misunderstandings if team members don’t understand how to interpret each other.

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies
Effectively managing conflict requires a lifetime of practice, but fortunately, everybody you’ll ever meet is going through the same experience. With practice, conflict recognition and resolution become natural habits for PMs. You can manage and resolve conflict by applying five strategies: smoothing, forcing, compromising, collaborating, and avoiding. You might apply multiple techniques to a single conflict, and you already use these strategies in your work and personal life.

Smoothing

The smoothing style is also called the "accommodating" style. This style attempts to redirect their attention away from the conflict. You would refocus the parties on something they agree on while de-emphasizing any differences. This strategy is usually a temporary measure to ease tension and get parties to where they are ready to negotiate a solution.

For example, suppose two team members disagree about the product’s color scheme. The conflict has escalated to where the opposing parties are talking over each other and insulting each other’s ideas. In this case, you could use a smoothing technique by reminding them that everybody on the team wants to create a good product, and the team can review what the customer needs to find a good color scheme. Reminding the group that the customer’s opinion is the most important can help them take a mental step back. Next, you could move to a collaborating technique by reviewing the problem, requirements, and ideas together.

Use a smoothing strategy when you need to de-escalate a conflict quickly. You can also use smoothing to reduce friction temporarily while you look for a long-term resolution.
Forcing

The forcing style is also called the "dominating" style. In this style, you would manage conflict by deciding what needs to happen to fix the issue. Emergencies are a perfect example of a forcing strategy; the team doesn’t have time to debate a solution in the middle of a fire. Somebody needs to make a decision and move on. Forcing can be a protective strategy, too.

Use a forcing strategy when you need to make a quick decision, in an emergency, or to ease the strain of unpopular resolutions.
Compromising

The compromising style requires both parties to meet in the middle. The people in the conflict share their insights and concede to change something but keep some part of their idea. Nobody gets everything they want, but they all receive something.

Use a compromising strategy when both parties are willing to give up something and both arguments have merit.
Collaborating

The collaborating style is also called a "win-win situation." In this scenario, the parties in the conflict work together to design a new idea that works for everybody. This is the most complex approach and requires the most skill, but it can also produce the most creative results. It requires the parties to commit to finding a solution.

Use this approach when the conflict’s outcome is critical and both parties are invested in the outcome.
Avoiding

An avoiding strategy ignores the conflict. For example, you might temporarily avoid the issue if you need time to assess the situation. Perhaps the conflict is minor and new and you want to give the team time to resolve it on their own. You can also choose this option if the problem is too small to address and isn’t affecting the team’s performance. Sometimes, a conflict is a “no-win” or “lose-lose” situation. In this scenario, you can’t resolve the dispute without causing harm to somebody else.

Use an avoiding resolution strategy when the issue isn’t hurting the team or resolving the issue won’t help the team.
#### Conflict Escalation


Recognizing conflict early is key to successful conflict management. Conflict will escalate when it isn’t addressed, increasing in severity and impact. Dr. Friedrich Glasl is a conflict researcher, mediator, and professor. He developed a conflict escalation model that describes conflict across nine stages.

In the early stages, 1–3, parties still want to agree. You can gently facilitate this conflict and enable the group to find a win-win resolution. They’ll move past the conflict and recover quickly. Escalations here are easily forgotten.

    Tension: conflict often not voiced or not recognized as conflict.
    Debate: parties begin trying to convince each other of their views.
    Actions replace words: there are no more discussions. Actions underline each party's stance. Empathy shrinks.

Unresolved conflict could escalate to a win-lose situation in stages 4–6. At this level, parties are competing and vying for control. In addition, they want to prove the other person wrong and will involve others in an attempt to build support. In these stages, you would need to mediate the dispute.

    Coalitions: parties look for supporters. The original issue becomes unimportant. Now it's about winning.
    Loss of face: opponents are disparaged. Exaggerations and lies circulate.
    Threats: parties try to gain control with threats.

An unresolved conflict that escalates to the level of the final three stages is a fully lose-lose situation. In stages 4–6, they wanted to win, and in stages 7–9, they want the other party to lose even at their own expense. At this point, the people involved in the conflict are incapable of resolving it themselves. They need somebody to intervene. Conflict at this level will destroy a project, if it hasn’t already.

    Limited destruction: opponents are not seen as human. Parties are fine with losing if their opponent loses more.
    Annihilation: opponents and their supporters are destroyed by any means necessary.
    Abyss: the parties careen together into disaster. Destruction of self is acceptable as long as the opponent is also completely destroyed.

As a result, PMs strive to resolve conflict before it reaches a win-lose situation. It’s easier for the team to recover from stages 1–3, and some disagreement at this level is desirable. “Healthy conflict” refers to these stages. Groups who are comfortable with sharing their opinions, trying new ideas, and setting boundaries will experience a fair amount of healthy conflict. They can move on if the team disagrees, debates, and resolves.

However, recovering from stages 4–9 is much harder than resolving early conflict. Even if the conflict is resolved, the memory and effects may linger. Team dynamics are shaken, and you may see unhealthy patterns, such as cliques. It causes potentially irreparable harm to the reputations of individuals, the team, and the PM. Public conflicts can harm the firm’s reputation as well. It can lead to team members losing their place in the team or company.
