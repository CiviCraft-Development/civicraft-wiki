# Moderation
Moderation is the most important job server management has. To keep the peace and keep the fun going, management should always be alert to any behavior that could possibly break our rules. Remember, moderation is everyone's job!

## Conflicts of Interests
Server management may find themselves in a situation where a conflict of interest arises. It may be that their friend or business partner is on the receiving end of the punishment or the issue may directly relate to something the member of management is involved with. Regardless of where the conflict of interest is generated from, it's conflict enough.

### Handing-Off a Matter

### Moderation Despite Conflict of Interest
Conflict of interests will occur and when they do, other members of server management should be prompted to step-in and take over the issue. However, there is no around-the-clock availability and at times, you may find yourself stuck in a situation where conflict of interest exists and no one can come to aid you. In these matters, you cannot ignore the issue and must move forward with punishment. This only applies to pressing Discord tickets (most likely none) and in-game.
