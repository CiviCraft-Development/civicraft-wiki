# Player FAQs

This is where you can find answers to questions we feel players frequently ask. This has been made available to players, though we trust that server management will be more likely to read the wiki.

## Q1: How do I get the resourcepack?
**A: The resourcepack is automatically downloaded when a player logs into the server.** In some instances, though, this may not be true for all players. The common causes are:
1. The player has server resourcepacks set to "Prompt" and denied the prompt, or they have it set to "Disabled" which automatically rejects the resourcepack.
   - They should change this setting by finding the server on their multiplayer tab, clicking it, pressing "Edit," and changing "Server Resource Packs" to "Enabled."
2. The player has encountered an issue where the resourcepack has not automatically applied to them despite having correctly accepted the pack.
   - This can be fixed by the player leaving the server and logging in again or, more preferably, running `/resourcepack` which will send them the pack.
### Q1.1: Where can I download the ZIP for the resourcepack outside automatically downloading it when I log in?
**A: You cannot.** CiviCraft strictly prohibits the downloading of its resourcepack. This is because nine times out of ten, the player trying to download the resourcepack ZIP file is attempting to extract the models and textures for their own use. Since we use assets created by other studios as well as our own, most of which are premium models, it would be irresponsible to hand them out for free. If a player asks this question, you should make note of it in #notes and/or alert upper management so we can monitor the player and prevent any leaks of our assets.
