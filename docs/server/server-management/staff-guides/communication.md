# Player Communication Guide

When talking to other players, regardless of the purpose of the interaction, it is important to remember that you are serving as the face of the server. When players watch your interactions, they develop assumptions about the server that impact a number of things. Effective and appropriate communication is the number one driver for creating a positive, engaging environment where players want to continue participating in.

The following guide reviews various directions on how to communicate with players as well as other staff.

## Introduction
As a reminder, this is not meant to forcibly dictate how you communicate on the server, but instead, it's meant to guide your interactions with players.

## General Communication Guidelines

### Respect and Professionalism
Regardless of any situation you may find yourself in, it is important to communicate respectfully and professionally with 

### Clarity and Conciseness
Getting an idea across may be challenging at times due to all the 

### Tone and Language

## Player Interaction

### Welcoming New Players
Player retention starts the moment a new player joins the server. The initial experience is crucial, as it sets the tone for their entire journey within the community. A warm welcome, clear guidance, and immediate engagement can significantly influence their decision to stay and explore further. By creating a positive first impression, we lay the foundation for long-term involvement, turning newcomers into active and engaged members of our community.

#### In-Game
CiviCraft features a custom plugin designed to reward players for welcoming newcomers and returning players to the server. Staff are encouraged to make use of the plugin's features to enhance player retention and to enjoy the rewards from the plugin.

This plugin incentivizes online players to welcome or welcome back others based on their join status. When the /welcome or /wb command is executed, the plugin selects a random welcome message and sends it to the target on behalf of the welcoming player, who is then rewarded for their action. Additionally, players with the highest number of welcomes recorded each month will receive special rewards, further encouraging consistent engagement and community-building.

Staff are also welcome to greet players through chat or message on their own, independent of the plugin.

#### Discord
There are two different ways to welcome a new member to the Discord.
1. Built-In Discord Welcoming
Discord offers a built-in feature that allows you to welcome new players with the click of a button. By clicking it, it automatically mentions the new user and sends a gif alongside it. 

While we would like to avoid this given how impersonal it may be, 
2. Personalized Welcoming (Recommended)

    - Welcome to the server @Player! So happy to have you!
    - Hello & welcome @Player! Let me know if you need any help (:

Tip: Try inviting a player to play with you.

Within the first 24 hours of a player being on the Discord, try prioritizing engaging with them. 
### Helping Players & Answering Questions
CiviCraft boasts a number of resources available to players to assist them in learning the server and easily getting an answer to 99% of their questions. In-Game tutorials of various lengths, video guides, a wiki, an in-game book, an automatic support bot and more are provided to players. However, we can never assume players will completely engage with these resources if they engage with them at all. While this can create difficulties for them, that's where management and guides step in!

#### Answer the Question Directly
Server Management should respond to player inquiries directly rather than only sending links or running automated commands -- of course, the player should be made aware of additional resources, but they shouldn't have to go to another place to get an answer that someone can easily give them. Additionally, providing personalized answers demonstrates attentiveness and care, making players feel valued and supported while they engage with our server. Here's a general template of what these replies should look like:

`Hey, @player, that's a great question! <Answer to question>. You can learn more about it here: <link>`

### Handling Player Complaints
In a server that values player feedback, we must know how to appropriately respond to players who have complaints about the server. While we cannot make everyone happy, we can definitely work with our players to find solutions and help them to the best extent we can.

#### Ask for Clarification as Needed
When a player makes a complaint, they may include too little detail, too much detail, or present information in a way that is unorganized and otherwise difficult to understand. It's vital to ask for clarification instead of proceeding with what you have been initially given in order to both shorten the process and ensure both you and the player are on the same page. 
#### Repeat the Player's Complaint Back to Them
Being on the same page from the get-go is important to resolving things in a timely and appropriate manner. When a player makes a complaint, it's important to repeat it to them, but in the way you understand it. This will help to bridge any gaps that may be created from the way the complaint is presented to the way that it is received and interpreted.

When doing this, be mindful of your tone. Check that you don't come off as if you are downplaying the issue or being condescending with your recap. Even if their complaint isn't a big issue to you, it was a big enough issue to them to mention, so we should look at things from their perspective instead of our own.

#### Provide a Detailed Plan
Players love certainty.

Another good component to include is external resources. This provides credibility to your response and gives players something to reference. Be mindful to not leave it at "you can find this here." Instead of doing this, explain what the resource is and give a good summary, but then attach the link to the resource and advise them that they can get this information in more detail there.

### Conflict Resolution
Techniques and approaches for resolving conflicts.

#### Causes of Conflict


Effective project management requires excellent conflict management skills. You will find innumerable causes of conflict throughout your career. People are distracted, worried, and complex. They are also talented, passionate, and knowledgeable. Conflict is inevitable when you bring a diverse group of people onto a team and each is an expert in their field. They will disagree on which software is best, which programming language to use, and where to go for lunch. To add to the complexity, people may conflict about a seemingly surface issue; meanwhile, the actual conflict is unseen and unspoken. For example, perhaps teammates arguing over a color scheme weren’t worried about that at all; instead, they were truly anxious about recent downsizing.

We’ll review a few causes of conflict in project teams in this course. Treat this list as a starting point, and add your own experience to it.

    Personality differences: people have different personalities and working styles, which can create conflict. Teammates need to learn to work together, but expect some friction while they learn how to collaborate.
    Personal issues: people have lives outside their team. Sometimes, their personal life affects how they approach the work, which can affect performance.
    External factors: events outside the group and unrelated to the project can affect the team. For example, conflict increases during reorganizations and severe world events.
    Competition over resources: when teams have inadequate time, supplies, access, or information, it can create a sense of scarcity among team members.
    Conflicting priorities: when team members don’t know where to focus or how to spend their time, it creates prioritization conflicts. For instance, team members could interpret project goals differently or be stretched too thin across many projects.
    Conflicting proposals: sometimes, two team members will create different ideas to solve a problem or approach a deliverable. Usually, this is healthy conflict that helps your team create the best result possible. For example, team members might brainstorm ideas and debate the merits of each to arrive at a solution.
    Communication issues: communication occurs in nearly every project activity. As a result, most conflict stems from communication issues. For example, team members who are active listeners can prevent and resolve conflict faster than those who need to develop their listening skills. Differences in writing styles, including formality, tone, and presentation, can lead to miscommunication and conflict. Cultural differences can include differences in communication, including tone, subtlety, and word choice. It can also include differences in typical expressiveness, body language, and personal space. Conflicting cultural norms can lead to misunderstandings if team members don’t understand how to interpret each other.

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies
You can manage and resolve conflict by applying five strategies: smoothing, forcing, compromising, collaborating, and avoiding. You might apply multiple techniques to a single conflict, and you already use these strategies in your work and personal life.

- Smoothing: Redirecting attention away from the conflict temporarily, focusing on common ground to ease tension and prepare for negotiation.

- Forcing: Making decisive decisions in urgent situations, ensuring quick resolutions without prolonged debate.

- Compromising: Finding middle ground where each party gives up something but gains a satisfactory outcome.

- Collaborating: Working together to create solutions that benefit everyone involved, fostering creativity and commitment to the outcome.

- Avoiding: Temporarily ignoring minor issues or situations where resolving the conflict may not significantly benefit the team.

#### Conflict Escalation


Recognizing conflict early is key to successful conflict management. Conflict will escalate when it isn’t addressed, increasing in severity and impact. Dr. Friedrich Glasl is a conflict researcher, mediator, and professor. He developed a conflict escalation model that describes conflict across nine stages.

In the early stages, 1–3, parties still want to agree. You can gently facilitate this conflict and enable the group to find a win-win resolution. They’ll move past the conflict and recover quickly. Escalations here are easily forgotten.

    Tension: conflict often not voiced or not recognized as conflict.
    Debate: parties begin trying to convince each other of their views.
    Actions replace words: there are no more discussions. Actions underline each party's stance. Empathy shrinks.

Unresolved conflict could escalate to a win-lose situation in stages 4–6. At this level, parties are competing and vying for control. In addition, they want to prove the other person wrong and will involve others in an attempt to build support. In these stages, you would need to mediate the dispute.

    Coalitions: parties look for supporters. The original issue becomes unimportant. Now it's about winning.
    Loss of face: opponents are disparaged. Exaggerations and lies circulate.
    Threats: parties try to gain control with threats.

An unresolved conflict that escalates to the level of the final three stages is a fully lose-lose situation. In stages 4–6, they wanted to win, and in stages 7–9, they want the other party to lose even at their own expense. At this point, the people involved in the conflict are incapable of resolving it themselves. They need somebody to intervene. Conflict at this level will destroy a project, if it hasn’t already.

    Limited destruction: opponents are not seen as human. Parties are fine with losing if their opponent loses more.
    Annihilation: opponents and their supporters are destroyed by any means necessary.
    Abyss: the parties careen together into disaster. Destruction of self is acceptable as long as the opponent is also completely destroyed.

As a result, PMs strive to resolve conflict before it reaches a win-lose situation. It’s easier for the team to recover from stages 1–3, and some disagreement at this level is desirable. “Healthy conflict” refers to these stages. Groups who are comfortable with sharing their opinions, trying new ideas, and setting boundaries will experience a fair amount of healthy conflict. They can move on if the team disagrees, debates, and resolves.

However, recovering from stages 4–9 is much harder than resolving early conflict. Even if the conflict is resolved, the memory and effects may linger. Team dynamics are shaken, and you may see unhealthy patterns, such as cliques. It causes potentially irreparable harm to the reputations of individuals, the team, and the PM. Public conflicts can harm the firm’s reputation as well. It can lead to team members losing their place in the team or company.
