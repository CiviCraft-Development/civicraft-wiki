# Special Projects

## Starting a Project
Projects are typically started at the discretion of Upper Server Management. These projects begin when there is an obvious need to put a considerable amount of focus on some aspect of the server.

## Joining a Project
## Player Advisors
Often times, players will be invited in to participate in projects. These players usually bring some expertise to the project, whether it be to supply an expert perspective on a specialized area or to just outline the player point-of-view on potential changes brought about by the project.
