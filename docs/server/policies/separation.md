# Management-Gov Separation

On CiviCraft, we make a strong effort to separate server management operations from government operations.

## Exemptions
There are a few efforts that are exempt from this policy.
### Department Advocates
Server Management may get involved with government operations in the role of Department Advocate (DA), who serve as a liaison between server management and department leadership. Each DA is typically assigned to a specific department, fostering a one-on-one relationship that facilitates effective communication.

The primary role of a DA is to advocate for the needs and priorities of their assigned department. By working closely with department leadership, DAs ensure that the department's requirements are clearly communicated to server management. This close relationship helps in understanding and addressing the department's unique challenges and needs.

In addition to advocacy, DAs also handle various server-side tasks on behalf of department leadership. This reduces the need for department leaders to submit tickets to server management, streamlining processes and saving time. By having a dedicated DA, server management gains a deep understanding of the specific needs of each department, leading to more efficient and tailored support.
