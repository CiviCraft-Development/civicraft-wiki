# Management-Gov Separation

On CiviCraft, we make a strong effort to separate server management operations from government operations. This distinction is crucial to maintain a balanced and fair environment for all players, allowing for no advantages within one sector based on current position in another.

## Why We Keep These Separate

1. **Maintain Fairness and Integrity:** By keeping server management and government operations separate, we prevent almost all potential conflicts of interest that may occur. Additional policies have been put in place to manage the remaining possibilities that could cause conflicts of interest to occur. With this, we can be certain that government decisions are made without undue influence from server management, and vice versa, maintaining fairness and integrity in both realms.

2. **Clarity in Roles and Responsibilities:** Distinguishing between management and government roles helps players understand the boundaries and expectations for each. This clarity avoids confusion about who is responsible for what, leading to smoother operations and better player experience.

3. **Improved Focus and Efficiency:** When server management and government roles are clearly defined and separated, each group can focus on their specific tasks. Server management can concentrate on maintaining the server's technical health and performance, while government entities can focus on engaging with the "real life" aspect of the game.

4. **Empowerment of Player Government:** By ensuring that player-run governments operate independently, we empower players to make meaningful decisions that impact the game world. This autonomy encourages creativity and engagement, making the CiviCraft experience more immersive and enjoyable for everyone!

## Exemptions

While the separation of management and government operations is a fundamental principle on CiviCraft, there are a few scenarios where crossover is necessary. The following does not cover all reasons for why an action may be exempt from this policy, but to summarize, all exemptions will be made in support of the server's community with a detailed explanation given each time an unexpected exception is made.

### Department Advocates

Server Management may get involved with government operations in the role of Department Advocate (DA), who serve as a liaison between server management and department leadership. Each DA is typically assigned to a specific department, fostering a one-on-one relationship that facilitates effective communication.

- **Advocacy and Communication:** The primary role of a DA is to advocate for the needs and priorities of their assigned department. By working closely with department leadership, DAs ensure that the department's requirements are clearly communicated to server management. This close relationship helps in understanding and addressing the department's unique challenges and needs.

- **Streamlining Processes:** In addition to advocacy, DAs also handle various server-side tasks on behalf of department leadership. This reduces the need for department leaders to submit tickets to server management, streamlining processes and saving time. By having a dedicated DA, server management gains a deep understanding of the specific needs of each department, leading to more efficient and tailored support.

### Government Jobs
Server management is permitted to apply for and attain positions working in the government. These positions must be application-based and not elected (President, Senator, etc.) or appointed (Secretary, etc.). This exception is made for server management so that they may enjoy some aspects of the server and are not completely confined to moderation and server management whilst keeping away from positions that they could earn due to their influence.

### Desperate Need
If a situation is presented where there is a desperate need for a member of server management to step into an appointed or elected role, they may. However, the need must be demonstrable and a solution should be found as soon as possible.
