# No Tolerance

At CiviCraft, we maintain a strict no tolerance policy towards individuals who engage in inappropriate sexual activities that threaten the safety and well-being of our community members. Our goal is to foster a positive and enjoyable environment where everyone can freely enjoy the server without fear of harassment or exploitation.

## Scope of the Policy

This policy specifically targets and prohibits the following activities:
- **Grooming**: Any behavior intended to establish an emotional connection with minors for the purpose of sexual exploitation or abuse.
- **Sexually Explicit Conversation or Roleplay**: Discussions or roleplaying involving explicit sexual content or themes.
- **Sharing Sexually Explicit Content**: Distribution or sharing of pornographic materials or sexually explicit images, videos, or text.
- **Unsolicited Sexual Advances**: Making unwelcome sexual advances or propositions towards others.
- **Sexual Harassment**: Behavior that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment through unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

## Commitment to Community Safety

- **Protection for All Members**: We are committed to protecting the safety and well-being of all community members, regardless of age, gender, or affiliation.
- **Promoting Enjoyment of Minecraft**: Everyone deserves a safe and enjoyable experience while playing Minecraft on CiviCraft.

## Reporting and Enforcement

- **Immediate Action**: Any instance of inappropriate sexual activity should be reported immediately to our staff through a discord ticket. This ticket will be restricted as much as the reporting player would like, but by default, it will be restricted to senior administration.
- **Investigation and Action**: Upon receiving a report, our staff will promptly investigate the matter and take appropriate action, which may include warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans depending on the severity of the offense.

## Publicly Available List of Known Sexual Predators

To further protect our community and others within the Minecraft gaming community, CiviCraft will maintain and host a publicly available list of known sexual predators. This list serves as a resource for other servers to reference during their own vetting processes and for players to be aware of individuals who have been found engaging in predatory behavior.

- **Purpose**: The list aims to provide transparency and accountability across Minecraft servers, helping to safeguard players from potential threats.
- **Accessibility**: The list will be made publicly accessible on our website, ensuring that server administrators and players can easily access and utilize this information.

## Conclusion

CiviCraft stands firm in its commitment to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all players. This no tolerance policy ensures that individuals who engage in inappropriate sexual activities are swiftly identified and removed from our community to uphold the safety and integrity of our server.

We encourage all players to familiarize themselves with this policy and to report any concerns or violations they encounter. Together, we can create a positive and enjoyable gaming environment where everyone can thrive. Thank you for being a part of our community and helping us uphold these standards.
