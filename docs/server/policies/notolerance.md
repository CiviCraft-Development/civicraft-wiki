# No Tolerance

CiviCraft has no tolerance for any individual who pose a threat to our community members. Our intentions are to create a positive and fun environment in which everyone may enjoy the server without becoming a target.

This policy is specifically targeted at individuals who perpetrate inappropriate sexual activities including but not limited to: grooming, engaging in sexually explicit conversation or roleplay, sharing sexually explicit content, unsolicited sexually advances, and sexual harassment. We actually work to protect our community members regardless of age, gender, or affiliation: you deserve to enjoy Minecraft.
