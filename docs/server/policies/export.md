# Exporting Works

## Introduction

At CiviCraft, we value the creativity and effort our players put into their creations. We believe in providing our players the freedom to export their hand-made structures, builds, and other in-game creations for use outside our server. To maintain fairness and ensure the integrity of this process, we've established a policy requiring proof of authorship as well as guidance on how to request your work.

## Why We Do This

1. **Encouraging Creativity:** We want to reward players who invest time and effort in creating unique and original content.
2. **Fairness and Integrity:** Ensuring that only the rightful creators can export their work prevents any potential disputes and maintains the integrity of the server.
3. **Community Support:** This policy fosters a supportive community where creators can share their work while respecting the contributions of others.

## Proving Ownership

To export a creation from CiviCraft, you must provide proof of authorship. Our primary tool for verifying ownership is the use of logs, provided either by the server itself or by plugins that produce logs. These logs show the history of block placements, modifications to blocks or items, and more that will most likely prove beyond a shadow-of-a-doubt who created what. This method is the most certain and verifiable. However, we offer other methods to prove that you created something. The following can be tricky to verify, so the validity of each will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

1. **Screenshots and Videos:** Players can submit screenshots or videos showing the building process. This is especially useful for larger projects where a time-lapse or series of progress shots can illustrate the creation journey. 
2. **Witness Statements:** If other players witnessed the building process, their statements can serve as supplementary evidence.
3. **Project Plans:** Detailed plans or blueprints used during the construction can also support your claim. We must be able to link it back to you.

If you did not make the requested creation or contributed less than half of the effort to complete it, there is another way to get it exported. You can obtain permission from the original creator to have their work exported to you. This consent must be provided directly by the builder and cannot be a screenshot, as those can be easily altered.

## Requesting Exportation

If you wish to export your creation, follow these steps:

1. **Submit a Request:** Send a request to the staff through the designated channel (e.g., a specific forum thread or a Discord channel). Include all relevant proof of ownership.
2. **Verification Process:** Staff will review the submitted evidence. This includes checking Core Protect logs and any additional proof provided.
3. **Approval and Export:** Once verified, staff will approve your request and assist with the export process, which may involve providing the necessary files or guiding you through the exportation.

## Staff Responsibilities

1. **Review Requests Promptly:** Staff will aim to review export requests within a reasonable timeframe, ensuring timely responses to players.
2. **Fair Evaluation:** All requests will be evaluated fairly based on the evidence provided, without bias or favoritism.
3. **Assistance with Export:** Upon approval, staff will assist with the technical aspects of exporting the creation to ensure a smooth process for the player.

## Penalties for Circumventing Process

CiviCraft strictly disallows any client-side modifications that would permit a player to steal a creation that they did not make or gain permission to access outside the server. We believe this to be a serious violation of our community standards and policies. It is highly disrespectful to the players who put genuine effort and creativity into their work. Unauthorized copying and exporting undermine the integrity and trust within our community, devaluing the hard work and dedication of our players.

### Unauthorized Client-Side Modifications

Using unauthorized client-side modifications to bypass our exportation process undermines the integrity of our community and disrespects the hard work of other players. Examples of such modifications include, but are not limited to:

- **World Downloader Mods:** Mods that allow players to download portions of the server's world without authorization.
- **Copy-Paste Tools:** Tools that enable players to copy and export builds they do not own.
- **Unauthorized Plugins:** Any plugins that facilitate the extraction of server data or builds without permission.

### Consequences of Violations

Violating our exportation policy will result in strict penalties. These are designed to protect our community and deter unauthorized actions.

#### First Offense

- **Warning:** The player will receive a formal warning from the staff. All rightful creators will be notified of this.
- **Temporary Ban:** A temporary ban of 1 month will be imposed to emphasize the seriousness of the violation and discourage further attempts.

#### Second Offense

- **Permanent Ban:** A permanent ban from the server will be issued. All rightful creators will be notified of this.
- **Blacklist from Community Projects:** The player will be blacklisted from participating in community projects and events.

### Our Efforts to Protect Creations

CiviCraft employs a combination of plugins to identify and alert to any events in which a tool to export creations is used. (Expand on this)

#### Community Reporting Encouraged

With mods constantly changing and evolving, our solutions may not catch every single act. Therefore, we encourage all players to report any suspicious activity that may indicate an attempt to circumvent our exportation process. Reports can be submitted through our designated reporting channels, such as our server forum or Discord.
