# Players First

Our foremost priority is to put players first in all decisions and changes. This policy outlines our unwavering commitment to the CiviCraft community, detailing the guidelines our staff team follows when implementing new features and making critical decisions. We also provide clear instructions on how players can report any concerns or suspected violations, ensuring transparency and accountability. By adhering to these principles, we aim to foster a supportive and engaging environment where every player feels valued, heard, and put *first.*

### Commitment to Players
At CiviCraft, we have dedicated countless hours to transforming the server from a simple concept into a fully functioning city roleplay experience. Our diligent effort in developing unique features, refining gameplay mechanics, and creating an immersive environment underscores our passion and commitment to excellence. However, all this hard work would be in vain without the active participation and enthusiasm of our players.

This is why we hold a strong commitment to our player community, ensuring that their experience is always our top priority. We are dedicated to maintaining an open line of communication, listening to player feedback, and making continuous improvements based on their needs and suggestions. Our goal is to create a welcoming, engaging, and enjoyable environment where every player feels valued and heard.

We believe that a vibrant and satisfied player community is the heart of CiviCraft, and we strive to uphold the highest standards of service and support to foster a positive and thriving community. Whether it's through regular updates, prompt issue resolution, or hosting exciting events and creating enthralling media, our commitment to doing right by our players is unwavering.

3. What feedback have we received from players regarding similar changes?
* Have players expressed a desire for this feature or change?
* What concerns have players raised that we need to address?

4. How will this implementation affect the balance and fairness of the game?

Through this careful and player-focused approach, we strive to create a vibrant, enjoyable, and dynamic environment for all who join CiviCraft.


### Report Concerns or Violations Regarding this Policy
Violating this policy would contradict the very principles upon which our server is built. Therefore, we take any breach of this policy extremely seriously and are committed to addressing any violations promptly and thoroughly.

To ensure that our commitment to putting players first is upheld, it's essential to recognize specific instances where this policy might be violated. Players might notice or experience the following issues, which would indicate a breach of our Player First commitment:
1. Lack of Communication and Transparency:
* *Example:* Major updates or changes are implemented without prior notice or explanation to the player community.
* *Impact:* Players feel blindsided by sudden changes and believe their input is not valued.

2. Ignored Player Feedback:
* *Example:* Multiple players have raised concerns or suggestions about a particular feature, but no action or response has been taken by the staff.
* *Impact:* Players feel that their voices are not heard and that their opinions do not matter.

3. Unfair Game Mechanics:
* *Example:* A new feature disproportionately benefits a small group of players, creating an imbalance in gameplay.
* *Impact:* Players feel the game is unfair and that favoritism is being shown, leading to frustration and disengagement.

4. Unaddressed Abuse or Harassment:
* *Example:* Reports of bullying, harassment, or inappropriate behavior are not promptly or adequately addressed by the staff.
* *Impact:* Players feel unsafe and unsupported, which can lead to a toxic community environment.

5. Technical Neglect:
* *Example:* Persistent technical issues, such as server lag or bugs, are not addressed despite numerous player reports.
* *Impact:* Players experience frustration and a decrease in the quality of their gaming experience.

6. Security Oversights:
* *Example:* Player data is compromised due to a lack of proper security measures, and the issue is not transparently communicated or resolved.
* *Impact:* Players lose trust in the server's ability to protect their information.

7. Biased Decision-Making:
* *Example:* Decisions appear to be influenced by favoritism towards certain players or groups, rather than what is best for the community as a whole.
* *Impact:* Players feel that the server is not a level playing field and that staff are not acting in the community's best interests.

When players report concerns or suspected violations, it is crucial that staff handle these reports with care, respect, and professionalism. It is advised that senior staff handle these reports. Here are the guidelines staff should follow:

1. Acknowledge the Report:

* Thank the player for bringing the issue to attention and assure them that it will be investigated thoroughly.
* Limit the ticket to only senior staff.

2. Investigate Promptly:
* Conduct a thorough investigation into the reported concern, gathering all relevant information and evidence.
* Maintain confidentiality throughout the investigation to protect all parties involved. Regardless of the content of the report, privacy is always a must.

3. Communicate Clearly:
* Keep the reporting player informed about the progress of the investigation and any actions taken.
* Provide clear and transparent explanations for the decisions made and steps taken.

4. Take Appropriate Action:
* Implement corrective measures promptly if a violation is confirmed.
* Ensure that similar issues are prevented in the future through policy updates, additional training for staff, or any other route to remediate.
* If the situation requires it, publish a public announcement detailing the incident and the steps that will be taken to resolve.

5. Follow-Up:

By addressing these violations promptly and effectively, we uphold our Player First policy and maintain the trust and engagement of our community.
