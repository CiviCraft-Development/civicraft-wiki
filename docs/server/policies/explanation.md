# Right to Explanation

CiviCraft believes that all players have a right to an explanation of actions upon request.



### Request an Explanation
Explanations may be requested by opening a staff ticket. Explanations will not be provided over direct messages in order to properly document executions of this policy to ensure they are being handled appropriately.
