# Mediation and Interference

At CiviCraft, we strive to maintain a fair and harmonious community where players can resolve disputes and issues effectively. To achieve this, we have established clear policies for Mediation and Interference, each serving specific purposes based on the nature of the problem.

## Mediation

### Request for Mediation

Players may request mediation from staff to help resolve server-related disputes or issues that do not involve governmental matters. Mediation is designed to facilitate communication and negotiation between players, aiming for a mutually agreeable resolution without direct staff intervention or punishment. Here’s how the mediation process works:

#### Initiation of Mediation
- **Player Initiative**: Any player involved in a dispute can initiate mediation by submitting a formal request to staff via Discord ticket.
- **Detailed Description**: The request should include a detailed description of the issue, parties involved, and desired outcome. This helps staff understand the situation and prepare for mediation.
- **Additional Parties Added**: The other party involved will be invited into the process as the steps to mediate the issue truly begins.

#### Mediation Process
- **Neutral Facilitation**: A designated staff member acts as a neutral mediator, facilitating discussions between the involved parties. Senior staff typically handles these situations.
- **Conflict Resolution Techniques**: Mediators use conflict resolution techniques such as active listening, negotiation, and problem-solving to help participants reach a fair and satisfactory resolution.
- **Mutual Agreement**: The goal is for the parties to agree on a resolution voluntarily, which may involve compromises or concessions from both sides.

#### Mediation Outcomes
- **Documentation**: All agreements or decisions reached during mediation are documented for transparency and future reference.
- **Implementation**: Once an agreement is reached, players are expected to abide by the terms agreed upon. Staff may follow up to ensure compliance and resolve any remaining issues.

## Interference

### Request for Interference

Players may request staff interference to address server issues directly related to governmental matters or significant community decisions that affect the server as a whole. Interference involves staff making decisions or implementing changes to ensure the server’s governance and overall well-being. These are almost rarely made as CiviCraft was built on the foundation of as little staff intervention as possible. However, certain situations may arise where it's crucial for staff to step in. Here’s how the interference process is handled:

#### Circumstances for Interference
- **Governmental Issues**: Issues related to governmental structures, elections, policies, or significant server-wide decisions that impact the community as a whole.
- **Community Welfare**: Situations where staff intervention is necessary to maintain order, fairness, or the integrity of the server environment.
  - Staff is present to facilitate many government changes, not stop them. Please be mindful of what is roleplay and what poses an actual risk to the server.

#### Interference Process
- **Player Initiation**: Players can formally request interference by submitting a detailed report or request outlining the issue and reasons for staff intervention.
- **Staff Assessment**: Staff members review the request, gather relevant information, and assess the situation to determine the appropriate course of action.
- **Decision-Making**: Based on their assessment, staff may make decisions or implement changes that address the issue, uphold server policies, or maintain community standards.
  - Namely, the decision-making process outlined in the Player First policy is what is mainly referenced in this process.

#### Interference Outcomes
- **Policy Adjustments**: Changes or adjustments to governmental structures, policies, or server rules to resolve issues and promote server stability.
- **Community Notification**: Players affected by the interference are informed of the decisions made and any resulting changes implemented.
  - This will typically occur as a server-wide announcement as decisions like these are both rare and often affecting the community at large.
- **Feedback and Follow-Up**: Staff may seek feedback from the community and monitor the impact of decisions made through ongoing communication and support.

## Conclusion

The mediation and interference processes at CiviCraft are designed to promote fairness, transparency, and community involvement in resolving disputes and addressing server-wide issues. Whether through mediation to foster dialogue and mutual agreement or interference to ensure governance and server integrity, these processes aim to maintain a positive and cooperative environment for all players.

We encourage all players to familiarize themselves with these policies and utilize them appropriately when needed to uphold the standards of our community. Together, we can ensure a supportive and enjoyable experience for everyone on CiviCraft.
