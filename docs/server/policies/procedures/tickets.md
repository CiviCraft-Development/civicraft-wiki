# In-Game Tickets
The core responsibility of server management is to assist players with any issues they encounter when engaging with our server. To streamline this process, CiviCraft developed CiviSupport, a custom ticket system designed to manage tickets efficiently while reducing the overall volume that management handles.

## Ticket Minimization
CiviSupport has been designed to streamline how players receive assistance, reducing the need for server management to handle a high volume of tickets. Players can still open traditional tickets for more complex issues, but we’ve implemented an in-game system that allows them to ask questions directly. This system helps players get answers to quick questions or resolve minor issues without having to go through the formal ticket process, which decreases the number of tickets management needs to address and improves response times overall.

### Guides
Guides within the Server Support team are dedicated to helping players learn how to navigate and play the server. While they aren’t responsible for resolving server-related technical issues, they are available to assist with player questions. Although this doesn’t eliminate the need for Server Management to intervene, it alleviates some of the workload by offloading general support responsibilities to Guides.

### Support ChatBot
A custom-developed ChatBot has been integrated to respond instantly to player questions, regardless of the chat the question is asked in. The ChatBot uses pattern matching to identify specific questions or phrases. Regardless of how a question is phrased, the ChatBot can respond with a direct message to the player, providing answers on the spot.

### Player-Independent Functions
Many issues can be resolved by players themselves using features that are specifically designed to reduce the burden on server management. These self-service options empower players to solve problems on their own, further minimizing the need for on-the-spot management intervention.
#### Player Reporting
Players can report others on Discord or in-Game via a form that is sent to staff who then deal with the report.
#### Staff Reporting
If a player would like to report a staff member, a form is available to do so that can be accessed from in-game or on the Discord.

### In-Game Guide GUIs
Every single feature available in CiviCraft has an accompanying guide within the game in the form of a GUI. These GUIs are designed to be concise and easy-to-understand with some having custom textures.
