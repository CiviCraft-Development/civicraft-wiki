# Reporting Management

## Submit Report
### Behaviors to Report
We hold members of server management to the same rules that players are held to. In addition to this, server management has additional standards they are expected to meet when interacting with players.

:::tip Breaking laws is a different thing

If a member of management breaks the law, the justice does not fall into our hands! They are free to participate in the criminal roleplay side of the server and should not be reported through the management report process for breaking laws. Visit the courts or a law office for that!

:::
## Discuss the Report
The report will be discussed separately with both the reporter and the reported. The reported member of SM will not be aware of who filed the report.

## Investigation

## Outcome
The outcome of the report will be determined based on the results of the investigation. Punishments will often be developed based on certain findings although any applicable rules and the pre-determined punishments with those rules will be used as a guideline. 
## Notes
### Privacy Throughout
The individual being reported will not be aware of who has submitted this report. From start to end, this report is handled by the owners of the server with no involvement from senior management.

To ensure privacy, tickets created will be automatically restricted. Additionally, the name of the ticket will not indicate the reporter or the individual being reported. The logs from this ticket will also not go in the usual channel for ticket logs, but in a restricted channel. These logs will not be viewable by anyone nor will they be published.
