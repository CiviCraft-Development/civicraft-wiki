# Punishment Appeals

## Submitting an Appeal
## Interpreting an Appeal
### Guiding Questions
## Deciding on an Appeal
### Accepted
### Denied
### Inconclusive
The result of "inconclusive" means that the appeal was found to be unsubstantial, but it does hold some weight. To handle this, the appellant should be welcomed back onto the Discord server and immediately brought into a private ticket to discuss the appeal further. Once this is complete, another vote will be taken and the result of accepted or denied will come.
## Considerations for Appeals
### All evidence must be verifiable
### Appeals should have a turn-around of 3-4 days.
Appeals will be checked on a daily basis. All appeals will be put to vote as soon as they are seen. The vote will last for 24-48 hours in which discussions will also be held using the guiding questions above. Once a final conclusion has been reached, a member of senior management should provide a response and take any additional actions needed.

*Should* means that it is advised. This is the goal, but appeal processes that last longer will not result in any repercussions.
