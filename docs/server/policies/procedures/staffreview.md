# Staff Review
Staff Reviews are periodic check-ins with members of Server Management (SM) to gauge how well the individual is doing in their role. These are intended to maintain an open-line of communication with the SM team and ensure they continue to understand the

## Regular Staff Reviews
Staff Reviews will occur every three months alongside the State of the Server report. These will be done for all members of the team regardless of last review. The review will be conducted twice, once through an anonymous form and the second time, directly in personal channels. Each review will contain different questions.

These reviews are intended to be informal and conversation-starting. We want to gather everyone's perspective on what we can do for each one of our team members.

### Questions on the Anonymous Form:
1. On a scale from 1-10, how enjoyable do you find it is to be a part of Server Management?
2. How well do you feel your contributions are acknowledged and appreciated by the team?
3. What would you say is the most challenging aspect of your current role?
4. On a scale from 1-10, how confident are you in the leadership of Server Management?
5. Is there anything you believe could improve your experience on the team?
6. Do you feel the communication within the team is effective? If no, please explain.
7. Are there any areas where you feel Server Management can improve?
8. Do you feel the current expectations of your role are clear?
9. How would you rate the support you receive from other team members?

Each question on the form is optional. While we encourage team members to answer each, it is not required. The answers to these questions are collected and reviewed and the results of this review will be announced for all SM members.

### Questions in Personal Channels:
1. How are you enjoying being a part of Server Management?
2. In the next 3 months, do you see yourself continuing in your role?
3. Are there any new responsibilities or projects you would like to take on?
4. Do you feel you have the tools and resources to succeed in your role?
5. What feedback, if any, do you have for the leadership team?
6. Are there any areas where you feel you could improve, or areas where you would like additional support?
7. What has been your biggest accomplishment in the last 3 months?
8. What's been your favorite memory you've made on CiviCraft in the last 3 months?

## Random Staff Reviews
Each month, 1-3 team members will be chosen at random for a staff review. These are intended to be more informal than regular staff reviews with no guiding questions outside of asking about current experience.
