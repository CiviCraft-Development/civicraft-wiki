# Giveaways

CiviCraft makes it a point to host regular giveaways. 

## Eligible Items
The following items are eligible to be given away by server management through official server channels. Giveaways that are not hosted by server management or not hosted through official server channels are allowed, but CiviCraft has no responsibility in ensuring that the prize is delivered to the giveaway winner(s) -- Enter at your own risk.

1. In-Game Currency
   - Server Management may give away in-game currency if the funds are available from a legitimate source and not just spawned in.
