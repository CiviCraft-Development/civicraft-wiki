# All Commands

Below is a collection of all commands. Commands are listed alphabetically. If you are looking for commands listed by feature, go to the specific feature's article.

To identify the role associated with specific commands, examine the text positioned between the command name and the action. For instance, exam.professor.status is executable by Professors but not by Citizens. Additionally, the presence of .player. signifies that the command is accessible to all users. Commands containing citizen are restricted to individuals who have completed and passed the Citizenship exam. Any command featuring text within brackets indicates multiple potential permission values, but none of these values permit execution by Citizens.
