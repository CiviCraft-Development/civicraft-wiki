# All Commands

Below is a collection of all commands. Commands are listed alphabetically. If you are looking for commands listed by feature, go to the specific feature's article.

Almost all commands, at bare minimum, require a player to hold the rank of Citizen. This rank can be attained at any time in the tutorial building (/tutorial) by taking the citizenship exam. In most cases, players should have attained this role their first time on the server.
