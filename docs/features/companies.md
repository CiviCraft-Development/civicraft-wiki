### Hiring
Companies have the ability to set their hiring status between the following:
- Open
  - Players may freely become employees of the company without any approval.
- Application
  - Players must submit an application and be approved before joining a company.
- Closed
  - No one may apply to the company.
  - **Note:** You can still hire players even if the company is set to closed.

#### In-Game Hiring Process
The In-Game hiring process is a structured approach to recruiting players to a company.
#### Discord Hiring Process
The Discord hiring process is a less-structured and more custom approach to recruiting players. #channel-name is a channel that is available on the official CiviCraft discord for hiring players. Employers may post advertisements for jobs available in their company and how to apply.
