## Get a Library Card
Library cards provide access to the library's vast inventory of player-written books. To obtain a library card, players must first achieve Citizen status. Once a player is a Citizen, they can acquire a library card and begin checking out books by completing one of the following options:
### Option 1: Take the Exam
Each library offers an exam that, once completed, automatically issues a library card to the player. The exam consists of two questions designed to inform the player about how to use their library card and the conditions under which it may be revoked.

### Option 2: Talk to a Librarian
Players can also obtain a library card by speaking with a librarian. The librarian will explain how to use the card and the circumstances that can lead to its revocation. After this brief orientation, the librarian will create a library card for the player, allowing them to start checking out books immediately.

### Additional Information

Only one of these options needs to be completed to obtain a library card. However, if players require further assistance or have any questions, librarians are always available to provide help and support.

With a library card, players gain access to a treasure trove of player-written books, enhancing their gameplay and enriching their in-game experience. Read below to learn more about how to get the full benefits of your library card!
