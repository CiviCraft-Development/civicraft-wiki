# Hobbies

Hobbies are a part of CiviCraft that allow players to explore different features of CiviCraft in a similar way to jobs. Some hobbies are offshoots of professional tracks, giving players the opportunities to explore their creative sides whilst engaged in other professional work if they so please. 

Currently, players are not limited to the amount of hobbies they may pick up.
### Available Hobbies
art, writing, woodworking, pottery, sculpting, sewing, music, cooking/baking, gardening, 
### Hobby Progression
Like jobs, players may progress in their hobbies. This progression looks different across various hobby tracks, but nonetheless, each new level presents new abilities.
