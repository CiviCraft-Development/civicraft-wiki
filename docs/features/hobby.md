# Hobbies

Hobbies are a core aspect of CiviCraft, allowing players to explore various features of the game in a way similar to jobs. Some hobbies are extensions of professional tracks, providing opportunities for players to tap into their creative sides while continuing with their professional responsibilities.

Currently, players are free to take up as many hobbies as they like, with no limits imposed.

To start a hobby, players must first attend an automated class to learn more about it. Just as in real life, where we don't instantly master hobbies without practice, players need to take the class before they can fully engage in their chosen hobby. Alternatively, live classes are occasionally hosted in which players can begin hobbies or enjoy a hobby alongside others.
