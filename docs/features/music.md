## Music Lessons
Music lessons are offered at the University as an automated class. Occasionally, live music classes may be hosted. These music classes teach real-life music theory as well as how to read sheet music. Additionally, they teach how to play instruments in the game with many of the lessons being applicable to real life.

## Piano Web Dashboard
There is a web dashboard that comes with pianos. In this dashboard, musicians can play MIDI files, play the piano using their keyboard, or even connect an actual piano and have all notes played on it played in-game!
