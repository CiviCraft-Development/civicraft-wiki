# Events

At CiviCraft, events are a major component of our gameplay experience, providing players with a variety of unique opportunities to engage, compete, and collaborate with one another. Whether it's an official server event or something led by the community, there's always something exciting happening!

## Hosted Events
Hosted Events are those that occur at a specific time and date and are often led by one or more players.
### DPA-Hosted Events
The **Department of Public Affairs (DPA)** is primarily responsible for hosting structured and curated events for the server. These events are designed to bring the community together through engaging activities that promote interaction and teamwork. DPA-hosted events may include everything from building contests and scavenger hunts to city festivals or roleplay-driven storylines that allow players to influence the outcome. The DPA strives to ensure that all events are well-organized, enjoyable, and aligned with the server's vision.

#### Key Features of DPA Events:
- **Scheduled Events**: Events are planned ahead of time, often promoted on both the Discord server and in-game.
- **Incentives and Rewards**: Participants can earn in-game money or exclusive items.
- **Community Focus**: Many of these events are designed to foster collaboration and relationships between players.

### Player-Hosted Events
Players are able to host their own events, either independently or in collaboration with the DPA.

#### How Player-Hosted Events Work:
- **Support from DPA**: Players can request assistance from the DPA for event setup, marketing, and coordination. The player responsible for event must contribute more than half of the required efforts.
- **Independence**: Players can also choose to completely manage their events, giving them full creative control over the format and rules.
- **Calendar Inclusion**: Regardless of the level of support, player-hosted events are added to the **official events calendar** on both **Discord** and **in-game**, ensuring maximum visibility and participation.

### Management-Hosted Events
In order to relieve the DPA from the pressure of constantly running events and to maintain accommodation for players across different time zones, **Server Management** occasionally steps in to organize large-scale or time-sensitive events. These events are usually designed to be more elaborate and can serve as server-wide spectacles that generate buzz and excitement.

#### Types of Management-Hosted Events:
- **Major Competitions**: These could include events like server-wide PvP tournaments or building competitions with high-stakes rewards.
- **Seasonal Events**: Special celebrations tied to real-world holidays or server lore.
- **Surprise Events**: Occasionally, Management may launch impromptu events to shake up the routine and surprise players with something new and unexpected.

## Auto Events

In addition to hosted events, CiviCraft features **Auto Events**, which are self-running, time-sensitive challenges that any player can participate in. These events provide an opportunity for ongoing engagement, even when there are no live-hosted events happening. Auto Events often span a week and allow players to complete tasks or challenges in exchange for rewards.

### Key Characteristics of Auto Events:
- **Leaderboard Challenges**: Many Auto Events are competitive, with leaderboards tracking player performance. At the end of the event period, rewards are distributed to top-ranking players.
- **Open Participation**: Players can join these events at any time during the active period, ensuring no one is left out.
- **Variety**: These events can range from resource-gathering contests to PvE challenges like hunting mobs or completing dungeons.

### Randomly Triggered Auto Events
CiviCraft also features dynamically triggered events, such as fishing tournaments or surprise scavenger hunts. These events are designed to break up the routine of city life and offer players a refreshing change of pace. For example, a random fishing tournament might appear, challenging players to catch the largest fish within a set time limit, with rewards going to the top anglers.

#### Examples of Random Auto Events:
- **Fishing Tournaments**: A surprise event where players compete to catch the most or largest fish.
- **Resource Races**: A timed event where players race to gather specific resources.
- **Survival Challenges**: Events that test playersâ€™ endurance and skills in hostile environments.

### Why Auto Events?
Auto Events help maintain consistent engagement by giving players a reason to log in and participate regularly, even during off-peak hours. By providing a mixture of planned and spontaneous activities, CiviCraft ensures that players always have something to look forward to.

In summary, the event system in CiviCraft is designed to cater to every kind of player, from those who love structured, roleplay-heavy activities to those who prefer spontaneous, independent challenges. Whether you're here for the grand, server-wide spectacles or just looking to join a quick fishing tournament, CiviCraft has something for everyone!
