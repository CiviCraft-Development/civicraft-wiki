# Death

When a player dies in CiviCraft, they can immediately respawn. However, death still exists in various forms and can come with various items.

## Obituaries

-Add a photo of an obituary book opened
If enabled (`/obituary on|off`), players will receive an obituary each time they pass away. These obituaries serve as a record of the player's in-game life, detailing their achievements, cause of death, and any memorable moments!

## Urns

When a player dies, there is a random chance that their head will drop. This head can be used to create an urn, a special keepsake that memorializes the player. To create an urn:
1. **Collecting the Head:** When a player dies, retrieve their head if it drops.
2. **Smelting:** Place the head in a furnace to smelt it into ashes.
3. **Crafting the Urn:** Combine the ashes with a pot to create an urn.

Urns can be displayed in homes or other significant locations, serving as a tribute to the player who passed away.

## Graves

### Functional
Functional graves are created everytime a player dies in the wild. These graves hold the player's items and a portion of the player's XP. Players are given the coordinates of their death where there grave will be located. They will then have five minutes to retrieve their items before other players gain the ability to rob the grave.

### Decorative
A player's head can also be used to create a decorative gravestone, providing a more traditional way to honor the deceased. To create a grave:
1. **Collecting the Head:** Retrieve the player's head upon their death.
2. **Crafting the Gravestone:** Use the head in combination with other materials to craft a gravestone.

Gravestones can be placed in cemeteries or personal plots, allowing players to pay their respects and remember their fallen friends.

## Death-Related Models
CiviCraft has many death-related models for players to make use of.
## Permanent Death
While most players respawn, not all players do! Players who break the rules repetitively or severely may receive the death penalty. This entails eating your last meal and then being killed with no way to respawn.
