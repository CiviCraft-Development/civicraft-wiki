# Death
When a player dies in CiviCraft, they may immediately respawn. However, on each death, a player may leave things behind and even gain something new.

### Obituaries
If enabled, players will receive an obituary each time they unfortunately pass away.
### Urns
When a player dies, they have a random chance of dropping their head. By putting this player's head in a furnace, it smelts into ashes. Then, combining these ashes with a pot will turn it into an urn.
### Graves
A player's head can also be used to create a gravestone.
