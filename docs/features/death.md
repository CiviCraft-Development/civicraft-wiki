# Death in CiviCraft

When a player dies in CiviCraft, they immediately respawn. However, each death comes with unique consequences and opportunities, from leaving behind mementos to gaining new items.

## Obituaries

### Memorializing the Fallen
If enabled, players will receive an obituary each time they pass away. These obituaries serve as a record of the player's in-game life, detailing their achievements, cause of death, and any memorable moments. They provide a way for friends and the community to remember and honor the deceased player.

## Urns

### Creating Keepsakes
When a player dies, there is a random chance that their head will drop. This head can be used to create an urn, a special keepsake that memorializes the player. The process involves:
1. **Collecting the Head:** When a player dies, retrieve their head if it drops.
2. **Smelting:** Place the head in a furnace to smelt it into ashes.
3. **Crafting the Urn:** Combine the ashes with a pot to create an urn.

Urns can be displayed in homes or other significant locations, serving as a tribute to the player who passed away.

## Graves

### Honoring the Deceased
A player's head can also be used to create a gravestone, providing a more traditional way to honor the deceased. To create a grave:
1. **Collecting the Head:** Retrieve the player's head upon their death.
2. **Crafting the Gravestone:** Use the head in combination with other materials to craft a gravestone.

Gravestones can be placed in cemeteries or personal plots, allowing players to pay their respects and remember their fallen friends.

## Additional Death Mechanics

### Dropped Items
Upon death, players may drop items from their inventory. Friends or other players can collect these items, which might include valuable resources, personal belongings, or unique equipment.

### Roleplaying Opportunities
The death and memorial mechanics in CiviCraft provide rich opportunities for roleplaying. Friends can hold memorial services, create dedicated graveyards, or keep urns as cherished mementos. These elements add depth and emotional resonance to the game, fostering a closer-knit community.

### Spiritual Legacy
CiviCraft also features spiritual or supernatural elements associated with death. Players might encounter ghosts, hauntings, or other mystical phenomena, adding an extra layer of intrigue and storytelling to the game.
