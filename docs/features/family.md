# Family

Family is an important part of everyday life on CiviCraft where players can marry one another, adopt other players, and build large families!

### Marriage
Players may marry other players with the assistance of a priest or a lawyer.
#### Divorce
Divorce may occur if two players no longer wish to be in a relationship with one another. Divorces often play out as a mutual agreement to separate or a petition to the courts. Very rarely, if one partner has a considerable amount of inactivity, server staff may process the divorce without mutual agreement or involvement with the courts.
### Adoption
Players may adopt others as well as be adopted themselves.
### Family Trees
As players expand their family, their family trees will also grow. Currently, family trees are limited to a player's most immediate family: their parent(s), their partners, and their own children.
