# Family

Family is an important part of everyday life on CiviCraft where players can marry one another, adopt other players, and build large families!

### Marriage
Marriage in CiviCraft is a significant social event where players can formalize their relationships with each other. To initiate a marriage:
- **Process:** Players typically seek out a priest or a lawyer within the game who is authorized to officiate marriages. Players are encouraged to schedule and plan a ceremony and invite guests, but this is not a requirement.
- **Benefits:** Married players may gain certain benefits depending on server rules, such as shared housing, joint finances, or specific in-game privileges.
- **Role-Playing:** Marriage ceremonies often involve role-playing elements, allowing players to customize their vows and celebrate with friends and fellow players.

### Divorce
Divorce provides players with the option to end their marriage if they no longer wish to remain in a relationship. The divorce process includes:
- **Mutual Agreement:** Most divorces occur through mutual agreement between both players. They may choose to part ways amicably and dissolve their marriage through an in-game process.
- **Court Petition:** In some cases, if players cannot reach mutual agreement, they may petition the courts within CiviCraft. This process may involve mediation or arbitration to resolve disputes over assets or custody.
- **Server Intervention:** If one partner becomes inactive for an extended period, server staff may intervene to process the divorce to ensure fairness and maintain gameplay integrity.

### Adoption
Adoption allows players to expand their families by legally adopting other players or being adopted themselves:
- **Process:** Players interested in adoption typically initiate the process by expressing their intent to adopt to the server community or through official channels.
- **Legal Framework:** Adoption within CiviCraft follows a legal framework that may require consent from both parties and adherence to server rules regarding familial relationships. This framework can be changed by lawmakers!
- **Benefits:** Adopted players may gain a sense of belonging within a new family structure, while adoptive parents can experience the joys and responsibilities of nurturing a virtual child.

### Family Trees
Family trees in CiviCraft provide a visual representation of player relationships and family dynamics:
- **Expansion:** As players marry and adopt, their family trees grow to include immediate family members such as parents, partners, and children.
- **Visualization:** Players can view their family tree within the game interface, which helps to track lineage and connections over time.
- **Legacy:** Family trees contribute to the legacy of player characters, showcasing the evolution of relationships and the establishment of generational ties within the game world.

These social features enrich the gameplay experience of CiviCraft by allowing players to simulate complex social interactions, build meaningful relationships, and create lasting connections within a virtual community.
