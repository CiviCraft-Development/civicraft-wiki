# Family

Family is an important part of everyday life on CiviCraft where players can marry one another, adopt other players, and build large families!

### Marriage
Marriage in CiviCraft is a significant social event where players can formalize their relationships with each other. To initiate a marriage:
- **Process:** Players typically seek out a priest or a lawyer within the game who is authorized to officiate marriages. Players are encouraged to schedule and plan a ceremony and invite guests, but this is not a requirement.
- **Benefits:** Married players may gain certain benefits depending on server rules, such as shared housing, joint finances, or specific in-game privileges.
- **Role-Playing:** Marriage ceremonies often involve role-playing elements, allowing players to customize their vows and celebrate with friends and fellow players.

### Divorce
Divorce provides players with the option to end their marriage if they no longer wish to remain in a relationship. The divorce process includes:
- **Mutual Agreement:** Most divorces occur through mutual agreement between both players. They may choose to part ways amicably and dissolve their marriage through an in-game process.
- **Court Petition:** In some cases, if players cannot reach mutual agreement, they may petition the courts within CiviCraft. This process may involve mediation or arbitration to resolve disputes over assets or custody.
- **Server Intervention:** If one partner becomes inactive for an extended period, server staff may intervene to process the divorce to ensure fairness and maintain gameplay integrity.

### Adoption
Adoption allows players to expand their families by legally adopting other players or being adopted themselves:
- **Process:** Players interested in adoption typically initiate the process by expressing their intent to adopt to the server community or through official channels.
- **Legal Framework:** Adoption within CiviCraft follows a legal framework that may require consent from both parties and adherence to server rules regarding familial relationships. This framework can be changed by lawmakers!
- **Benefits:** Adopted players may gain a sense of belonging within a new family structure, while adoptive parents can experience the joys and responsibilities of nurturing a virtual child.
