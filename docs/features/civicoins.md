# CiviCoins
CiviCoins is the server's currency for purchasing cosmetics that are not accessible through crafting, progression, or achievements in-game. It's a way to exhibit appreciation to our players and their dedication to the server.

### How to Get CiviCoins
CiviCoins can be obtained in various circumstances.
#### Bug Reporting
CiviCoins are granted to players who help staff identify bugs within the server.
#### Server Events
Participating in server events is a guaranteed way to rack up some CiviCoins. Even better, players who place in competitive events will receive additional CiviCoins.
#### Assisting Others
Players who go out of their way to help others will never go unnoticed by CiviCraft.
#### Server Playtime & Voting
The more you play and vote, the more you support the server.
#### Content Creation
CiviCraft goes out of its way to thank and reward players who take the time to create server content. The server boasts a variety of perks for content creators, but one specific one is the allocation of CiviCoins with each new upload.
#### Server Participation
This covers playtime, running in elections, roleplaying, and even just chatting. These activities are rewarded at random but rewarded nonetheless.

### CiviCraft Shop
The server shop only accepts CiviCoins and operates entirely in-game so that players may access the shop and their purchases with little delay or fault. There is no other CiviCraft server store, and we do not accept payments using real-life or in-game money.
