# Player Analytics (PLAN)

Player Analytics, otherwise known as PLAN, is a plugin developed by AuroraLS3 that allows for players to track their server statistics through an accessible web dashboard. Through this, players may access various data about themselves and how they interact with the server.

### Statistics and Data Tracked
##### Sessions
PLAN records each time a player logs on. It documents the date and time (listed in UTC) a player has joined as well as the length of their session and which world(s) they played on.
##### PvP & PvE
Whenever a player kills or dies to a player or mob, PLAN not only records the event but also calculates the player's average kill-death ratio (KDR) for both players and mobs. This calculation considers the number of kills and deaths within the past 7 days, the past 30 days, and throughout all gameplay history. In addition to this, PLAN logs a player's top three deadliest weapons and the most recent players they have killed.
