# Elections

## Political Parties
Political parties in CiviCraft play a crucial role in shaping the game's political landscape and governance. They are organized groups of players who share common principles, ideologies, and policy goals. Here are key points about political parties:

- **Formation:** Players can form political parties by registering with the game's electoral authorities. This typically involves outlining the party's platform, leadership structure, and goals.

- **Platform:** Each party develops a platform that outlines its stance on various issues such as economy, social policies, foreign affairs, and more. This platform serves as a blueprint for what the party intends to achieve if elected.

- **Membership:** Players can join a political party based on their alignment with the party's platform and goals. Membership may grant benefits such as participating in party decision-making, running for office under the party's banner, and accessing party resources.

- **Campaigning:** Parties engage in campaigning to promote their platform and candidates during elections. This includes advertising, organizing events, and mobilizing supporters to vote.

- **Influence and Governance:** Successful parties that win elections can influence legislation, policy decisions, and the overall direction of the game world. They may hold positions such as mayoralties, council seats, or even higher offices depending on game mechanics.

- **Coalitions:** Parties may form alliances or coalitions with other parties to gain majority support in governing bodies or to achieve specific policy objectives.

- **Role-playing and Interaction:** Political parties also serve as hubs for role-playing and interaction among players who share similar interests and ideologies. They contribute to the immersive and dynamic nature of political gameplay in CiviCraft.

Political parties in CiviCraft provide players with opportunities to participate in democratic processes, influence game events, and collaborate with others to achieve common goals. More information about political parties can be found in the [political parties article](https://wiki.civicraft.net/docs/features/political-parties).

## Election Types
CiviCraft's election system supports various types of election counting methods. Players in the government can pass legislation that decides on which election type is used it each type of election.

### First-Past-The-Post (FPTP)
**Description:** The candidate with the most votes in a single-member district wins the election.

**Example:** In a district with 100 voters, if Candidate A receives 40 votes, Candidate B receives 35 votes, and Candidate C receives 25 votes, Candidate A wins.

### Proportional Representation (PR)
**Description:** Seats in a multi-member district are allocated proportionally based on the percentage of votes each party receives.

**Example:** In an election with 100 seats, if Party A receives 40% of the votes, Party B receives 35%, and Party C receives 25%, then Party A gets 40 seats, Party B gets 35 seats, and Party C gets 25 seats.

### Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)
**Description:** Voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed based on next preferences. This continues until a candidate wins a majority.

**Example:** In an election, if no candidate receives more than 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on second choices. This process repeats until a candidate wins a majority.

### Two-Round System
**Description:** If no candidate wins a majority in the first round, a second round is held between the top two candidates.

**Example:** In the first round, Candidate A gets 45%, Candidate B gets 30%, and Candidate C gets 25%. Since no candidate has a majority, a second round is held between Candidates A and B, where the candidate with the most votes wins.

### Single Transferable Vote (STV)
**Description:** Voters rank candidates by preference in multi-member districts. Candidates must reach a quota to be elected. Excess votes for winning candidates and votes for eliminated candidates are transferred according to voter preferences.

**Example:** In a district with 3 seats and 100 votes, the quota to win a seat is 25 votes. If Candidate A receives 30 votes, 5 surplus votes are transferred to other candidates based on preferences. This process continues until all seats are filled.

### Block Voting
**Description:** Voters have as many votes as there are seats to be filled, and the candidates with the most votes win.

**Example:** In an election with 3 seats, a voter can vote for 3 candidates. The 3 candidates with the highest vote totals win the seats.

### Cumulative Voting
**Description:** Voters have as many votes as there are seats, but they can distribute their votes among candidates as they choose, including giving multiple votes to a single candidate.

**Example:** In an election with 3 seats, a voter has 3 votes. They can give all 3 votes to one candidate or distribute them among several candidates.

### Approval Voting
**Description:** Voters can vote for as many candidates as they approve of. The candidate with the most votes wins.

**Example:** In an election with 5 candidates, a voter can vote for Candidate A, Candidate C, and Candidate D. The candidate with the highest number of votes wins.

### Borda Count
**Description:** Voters rank candidates in order of preference. Points are assigned based on the ranking (e.g., 1 point for last choice, 2 points for second-to-last, etc.). The candidate with the highest total points wins.

**Example:** In an election with 4 candidates, if a voter ranks them as A > B > C > D, Candidate A gets 4 points, B gets 3, C gets 2, and D gets 1. The candidate with the most points across all voters wins.

## Election Phases
### Declarations
The election period begins when declarations open. During this phase, eligible players can contest for a position either as an Independent candidate or as a member of any registered political party. Candidates must meet specific criteria to be eligible, which may include citizenship status, playtime requirements, and other qualifications. This phase is crucial as it sets the stage for the upcoming campaign and election. Candidates will need to declare in-game during the declaration period by visiting the Department of State (/gps DOS).

### Campaigning
After declaring their candidacy, players enter the campaigning phase. This is a critical time to gather support and convince other players to vote for them. Campaigning can be done in various ways, including:
- **Posting Advertisements:** Use in-game advertisements, billboards and storefronts, the discord #campaign channel, or social media to share campaign messages and media.
- **Creating Campaign Discords:** Create a Discord server for your campaign to connect with supporters and outline your policies.
- **Rallies and Events:** Organize events or rallies to meet potential voters and discuss your platform.
- **Direct Communication:** Engage with players through private messages, chats, or in-game meetings to answer questions and gain support.
- **Endorsements:** Seek endorsements from influential players or groups to boost your credibility and reach.

### Voting
Once the declaration period ends, the Department of State performs final checks to ensure all declarations are valid. This includes verifying candidate eligibility and confirming that any additional requirements have been met. After these checks, the voting phase begins. Players can cast their votes at multiple polling stations around the map. These locations may change and will always be published with election information. Players will always be able to cast votes at the Department of State building, the New Player Center, and the Capitol.

To vote, a player must hold the rank of Citizen by taking the citizenship exam. Then, they may visit any polling location and access an Electronic Voting Machine. There, they may cast their votes. Once a player successfully votes, they will receive a wearable "I Voted" sticker!

It's important for candidates to remind their supporters to vote and provide information on how and where to do so.

### Results
After the voting phase concludes, votes are tallied, and the results are announced first on the Discord, then in-game. In summary, this phase involves the following:
- **Counting Votes:** Election officials count the votes cast at each polling station with the assistance of the automated vote counting system.
- **Verifying Results:** Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the vote count to prevent fraud or errors.
- **Announcing Winners:** Officially announcing the winning candidates and, if applicable, any runoffs or secondary rounds if no candidate achieves the required majority.
- **Post-Election Procedures:** Addressing any disputes or challenges to the results and transitioning the winners into their new elected positions.

## Ensuring Election Integrity

### Redundancy
CiviCraft's proprietary election plugin has been meticulously designed and rigorously tested to handle various types of elections. Given the critical importance of elections and the potential consequences of any failure, the plugin incorporates extensive redundancy measures. This design ensures that if votes are lost through one storage option, they are still securely available through alternative storage routes. This multi-layered approach to data protection guarantees the reliability and integrity of the election process, safeguarding against any potential issues that could compromise the outcome.

### Access Control
Strict access control measures are implemented to safeguard the election process. Only authorized players can access election data and results. Staff has no permission to access or modify election data. The plugin has been tried and tested to ensure that no one may gain unauthorized access to election data nor gain the privileges needed to modify election data.
