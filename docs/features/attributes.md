# Attributes

Attributes are a way to increase your physical capabilities, such as lung capacity, natural immunity, and movement speed, within the server.

Attributes are a unique gameplay mechanic designed to allow players to train and expand their physical capabilities within CiviCraft. Attributes empower players to tailor their characters to fit their preferred play-style rather that be anywhere from a couch potato to an Olympic athlete - the possibilities are truly endless!

In CiviCraft, we've incorporated innovative methods for players to train their Attributes. PLayers can enhance their character's strength by engaging in everyday tasks like mining or chopping wood, or by participating in exciting challenges and quests that test your mettle. Additionally, for those seeking a more structured approach to training, we've introduced usable gym equipment within the game that can be found both in recreational centers and privately-owned gyms. However, be warned, Attributes can also dwindle with time if you forget to train them!

Below is a list of all available Attributes and how to train them.

#### Strength
The Strength Attributes is a capability that lets players work faster. Rather it be swinging a sword or mining away at your 38483rd copper vein, the stronger you are, the faster you'll do it. 

#### Speed
The Speed Attribute is one that can only be built in a single way: running! The more you run, rather it be on a treadmill or out and about the city, the faster you gradually become!

#### Endurance
The Endurance Attribute can be built in a multitude of ways all having to do with taking damage. In return, the player gains extra hearts as well as a heightened natural immunity making trips to the doctor much less frequent.

#### Agility
The Agility Attribute can take you higher as you break past normal jumping limits in Minecraft the more you train.

#### Reflexes
The Reflexes Attribute makes you figuratively quicker on your feet, significantly decreasing your chance of taking damage.

#### Lung Capacity
The Lung Capacity Attribute allows you to spend a longer time underwater without any special gear to extend the life of your bubbles.
