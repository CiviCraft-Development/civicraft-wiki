# Mail

CiviCraft has a fully automated mail system to get player's messages and packages from point A to point B seamlessly.

## Getting a Mailbox
To get a mailbox, players should visit the post office at `/gps start postoffice`. At the post office, players may either choose to purchase a P.O. Box or a mailbox.

### PO Boxes
A post office box (PO Box) is a secure mailbox located within the post office where individuals can receive mail. To send mail, players with a PO Box will have to visit any post office and send it through the postal service clerk. Alternatively, players can access collection boxes throughout the city to send mail.
### Mailbox
A mailbox is different from a post office box in that it can be placed anywhere, and it can be used to send and receive.

## Sending and Receiving Mail
### Sending
Mail can be sent from a mailbox, a collection box, or by directly interacting with a postal worker.
### Receiving
Mail can be received in a mailbox or a PO Box. If a player sends mail to a player that does not own a PO Box or Mailbox, the player will still be able to retrieve it from a postal service clerk at the designated location it was sent to.

## Post Office Locations
Post Offices can always be located by using the map and enable the markers for mail services. This will show the locations of all post offices and in extension, collection boxes around the map.
