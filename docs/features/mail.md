# Mail

CiviCraft has a fully automated mail system to get player's messages and packages from point A to point B seamlessly.

## Getting a Mailbox
To get a mailbox, players should visit the post office (/gps start postoffice). At the post office, players may either choose to purchase a P.O. Box or a mailbox.

### PO Boxes
A post office box (PO Box) is a secure mailbox located within the post office where individuals can receive mail. 
### Mailbox
A mailbox is different from a post office box in that it can be placed anywhere, and it can be used to send and receive.
