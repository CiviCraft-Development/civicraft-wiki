# Prison

### Prison Sentences
#### Government Sentences
#### Staff Sentences
A portion of the prison is reserved for players who break server rules. Two sections are specifically reserved for sentences initiated by staff. Both units do not permit players to explore as freely as prisoners would in government-maintained units.
##### Transitional Unit
The Transitional Unit holds players who are meant to be temporarily banned for offenses that do not involve hacking.
##### Range 13
Range 13 is otherwise known as Death Row. Players who are meant to be permanently banned for offenses that do not involve hacking or do not pose an immediate, serious threat to the community are housed here until their execution date. This division is extremely secured with constant surveillance as well as an impenetrable design. Each offender is housed in a secluded room with only the ability to speak in the local prison chat.

### Death Penalty
CiviCraft reserves death penalties for those who have committed severe offenses that do not involve hacking or do not pose an immediate, serious threat to the community.

When a player is sentenced to death, they are held in Range 13 for the duration of 30 real life days. The player is provided a date of execution within 3-5 days of their original sentencing. The player may choose to accept their fate, request a reprieve, or appeal their sentence.

### Prison Escape
There are many ways to escape prison from social engineering to devising a complex escape plan.
