## How the Courts Work

### Filing a Case
To file a case, players must submit a complaint to the appropriate court. The complaint should include a detailed description of the issue and any evidence supporting the claim.

### Pre-Trial
During the pre-trial phase, both parties gather evidence and may engage in mediation to resolve the dispute without going to trial. If mediation fails, the case proceeds to trial.

### Trial
Trials are conducted in a courtroom setting with a judge presiding. Both parties present their arguments, evidence, and witness testimonies. The judge then delivers a verdict based on the evidence and server laws.

### Appeals
If a party is dissatisfied with the verdict, they may file an appeal to a higher court. The appeals process involves a review of the original case and may result in a new trial or a modification of the original verdict.

### Sentencing and Enforcement
In criminal cases, if the defendant is found guilty, the judge will issue a sentence, which may include fines, imprisonment, or other penalties. In civil cases, the judge will issue a ruling that outlines the remedies or actions required to resolve the dispute. Depending on the ruling, the Department of Justice may need to assist in carrying it out.

## Additional Categories

### Court Records
All court cases and decisions are documented and accessible to the public for transparency and reference. These records are available in three locations: the courthouse, the National Archives, and the Main library's reference room.

### Jury Duty
Players may be called to serve on a jury for certain cases, providing a verdict based on the evidence presented during the trial.

### Courtroom Etiquette
Players are expected to adhere to courtroom etiquette, showing respect to the judge, legal representatives, and all parties involved in a case.
