### How to Create a Group
#### Group Types
### Group Discord Template
To support groups, CiviCraft has created a general template that is ready-to-go for any group wanting to have their own server for communicating outside the server.

We also encourage players to create their own templates either from scratch or by sharing their own discords for others to use. If you have a server template to share, please open a staff ticket!
