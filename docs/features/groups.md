# Groups

## Creating a Group
When creating a group, there are several things to configure to define what your group does and who it's for.
### Group Types
The following are a list of group categories that are available in-game. You can choose your group's category or run the command `/group setcat [GroupName] [Category]`

Groups are only allowed to have 1 category at a time.

| **Group Category**        | **Info**                                                                            |

### Group Discord Template
To support groups, CiviCraft has created a general template that is ready-to-go for any group wanting to have their own server for communicating outside the server.

We also encourage players to create their own templates either from scratch or by sharing their own discords for others to use. If you have a server template to share, please open a staff ticket!
