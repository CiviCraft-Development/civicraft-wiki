# Groups

## Creating a Group
When creating a group, there are several things to configure to define what your group does and who it's for.

### Group Types
The following are a list of group categories that are available in-game. You can choose your group's category or run the command `/group setcat [GroupName] [Category]`.

Groups are only allowed to have one category at a time.

## Advertising Your Group
Once you've created your group, it's important to get the word out to attract members. Here are some ways to advertise your group:

### In-Game Advertisements
Use the in-game announcement system to broadcast your group's activities and meetings. This can help reach a wide audience of players who might be interested in joining.

### In-Game Events Calendar
Players can request through the Department of Public Affairs to have their meeting posted on the in-game events calendar. To add your meeting, contact the DPA in-game or through a support ticket!

### Social Media 
Leverage social media platforms like Discord and CiviSocial to promote your group. Share updates, meetings, and achievements to engage with potential members.

## Hosting Meetings
