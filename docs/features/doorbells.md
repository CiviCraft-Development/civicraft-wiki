# Doorbells

Doorbells are an interactive feature that allow players to add audible cues to doors using buttons. When a button is pressed near a door, it triggers a pleasant chime or sound effect of your choice, enhancing the atmosphere and functionality of your builds.

## How to Use Doorbells

### Adding a Doorbell
To add a doorbell to a door:
1. Place a button within a 1-block radius of the door.
2. Use the command `/doorbells set <SOUND>` to assign a sound to the doorbell.
    - Example: `/doorbells set block.note_block.chime`

#### Available Sounds
The following is a list of all available sounds. This is based on Minecraft-provided sounds although not all are available.

### Managing Your Doorbell
You can manage your doorbells with the following commands:
- `/doorbells list`: See all available sounds you can use for doorbells.
- `/doorbells remove`: Remove the doorbell associated with the button you're looking at.
