#### Idea Generation
CiviCraft hosts a number of ideas available for public use that content creators in the program or not may take advantage of. However, program staff can provide personalized ideas based on a content creator's request. When making a request, consider if you want to create a series or a one-off video, if it will be long-form or short-form, and the style of video you would like to make. Share this with program staff for optimal ideas! We can also help you work through ideas to get a better idea of how to go about executing them.

### Free Advertisement
Content created by those in the program about CiviCraft will not only be advertised to the entire playerbase, but will also be advertised on different platforms.

:::note Opting-Out of Advertisement

Content creators can partially or completely opt out of free advertisement if they would not like us to advertise their videos.

#### External Advertisement
When a content creator uploads a new video, program staff will share it on various discords and websites to increase traffic to the video. Content Creators are encourage, but not required, to share information about where traffic is coming to view their video from so that we can better refine our advertising practices.

CiviCraft will never claim a video created by a content creator was made by anyone else **but** the content creator. We value your efforts and will never take credit for your hard work!
