# Common Minecraft Scams

## Staff/Authority Impersonation

Staff members at CiviCraft will never contact you directly regarding __issues that affect your ability to play on the server.__ At CiviCraft, we always put an emphasis on collaboration, teamwork, and record-keeping so that all staff members are on the same page. Direct messaging (DM) a player about such matters would violate our principles and procedures and as a result, we will always contact players via ticket and never through other means that cannot be documented.

If you receive a direct message from someone claiming to be a staff member, or if a staff member contacts you about an issue that should be managed through our official channels, please report it immediately. Open a ticket to notify us about the incident so we can take appropriate action and maintain the safety and integrity of our community.


### Recognizing Impersonation Scams

Impersonation scams involve individuals pretending to be someone they're not, often to gain your trust and trick you into divulging sensitive information or taking harmful actions. In the context of Minecraft servers, scammers may impersonate staff members to manipulate players.

#### Common Tactics of Impersonators

1. **Urgent Messages**: Scammers may send urgent messages claiming there's an immediate issue with your account or something else that they insist must be done as soon as possible.
2. **Requests for Personal Information**: They might ask for your password, email address, or other personal information.
3. **Links to Fake Websites**: These links may lead to phishing sites designed to look like official CiviCraft pages.
4. **Offers of Free Items or Ranks**: Promising rewards in exchange for your cooperation.

### This Scam Falls Under...

1. **Phishing**: Scammers often use impersonation to gather personal information through phishing techniques. They might create fake login pages or ask for details that could compromise your account.
2. **Data Theft**: By pretending to be staff, they can trick players into giving away sensitive data, leading to account theft and potential financial loss.
3. **Malware Distribution**: Links provided by these scammers can lead to malware downloads, which can harm your computer and steal your information.

### How to Protect Yourself

1. **Verify the Source**: Always check if the person contacting you is a verified staff member. Look for official badges or contact them through known, secure channels.
2. **Do Not Share Personal Information**: Never share your password, email, or other sensitive information with anyone claiming to be staff. Please also note that there is no official CiviCraft source that requires you to input this information. We have no personal information to store, so we will NOT ask for it!
3. **Use Official Channels**: If you receive a suspicious message, report it immediately through CiviCraft's official ticket system. Do not engage with the scammer.
4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Protect your account with an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

### Reporting Scams

If you encounter someone impersonating a staff member, it's crucial to report the incident immediately through our ticket system. Provide as much detail as possible, including screenshots or screen recordings of the messages and any other relevant information. Avoid engaging further with the scammer to prevent any potential risks.

CiviCraft staff will prioritize the resolution of these reports to ensure the safety and integrity of our community. Our staff will thoroughly investigate the incident and take appropriate action, which often includes removing the scammer from the server. Additionally, we will make a public announcement to inform the community about the scammer and the details of the scam to raise awareness and prevent further incidents. We will not share any personal details of the reporting player in these announcements unless explicitly requested.
